POWER WHERE POWER IS NEEDED ...
OUR CORE COMPETENCE: THE IDEAL BASIS FOR POWERFUL ADVANCEMENTS.




We manufacture liquid-cooled transformers for distribution networks in accordance with DIN EN 50588. From these, we derive
products that can be integrated perfectly in specific applications, e. g.:
• liquid-cooled three phase transformers for distribution             • liquid-cooled single-phase transformers for railway 		
  networks of power supply companies                                    applications
• liquid-cooled three-phase transformers in low-loss design           • arc suppression coils
  for decentralized energy generation                                 • neutral earthing transformers
• liquid-cooled three-phase multi-winding transfomers                 • earthing transformers
  for special requirements                                            • liquid-cooled transformers with insulating fluids for special
• liquid-cooled three-phase transformers for wind power                 requirements, e. g. fire protection or environmental issues
  plants                                                              • controllable local plant transformers
• liquid-cooled special three-phase transformers for 		
  industrial plants
