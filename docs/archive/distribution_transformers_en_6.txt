     Reducing transformers’ noise emissions is becoming increasingly                      for even better integration in your application
     important. This is why, in addition to standard design (DIN EN                       conditions.
     50588), SBG-transformers are also available with reduced loss
     and noise levels.

     Alongside the selection of the appropriate induction and core
     material, the method of dovetailing legs and yokes in “step-lap”
     design has a positive impact on the transformers‘ noise emissions
     and losses.
