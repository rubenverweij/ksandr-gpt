OPERATING INSTRUCTION B / 2021

   3.5 HV and LV connections:
 		     3.5.1 In order to connect the HV and LV bushings, clean the connectors and use the following torque
			            (without lubricant):
               Bolt:     M 12: 15.5 Nm            Connection flag with screw:     M 10: 40.0 Nm
		                       M 20: 52.0 Nm		                                          M 12: 70.0 Nm
					                                                                             M 16: 110.0 Nm
			            The torqueâ€™s and the network connections are to be checked by the assembly firm before and after the
			            connection.
		      3.5.2 Check and verify the bushing phase connections.
		      3.5.3 Connect the HV side with plug connectors when cone bushings are fitted. Remove protective cap/cover and
			            check contact area to be clean and dry, plug connector in plug-in bushings and tighten it.
		       3.5.4 The network connections should be mounted not to introduce additional tension stress on the bushings.
		       3.5.5 When a cast resin monobloc is used for the LV bushings, use a maximum torque setting of 25Nm to check
			            whether the monobloc is fastened.
   3.6 If installed, check and verify the distance between the upper and lower arching horns (typically on Porcelain
		      bushings): Um = 7,2 kV : 60 mm; 12 kV : 85 mm;
				                  Um = 17,5 kV : 115 mm; 24 kV : 155 mm;
		       		           Um = 36 kV : 220 mm at mean sea level
   3.7 If provided, connect, and check auxiliary devices (controlling devices etc.) alarm and trip signals.
   3.8 If transformers are provided with different ratios, the required ratio can be adjusted according to the circuit
		      diagram, the marking, and the rating plate. Ensure that the correct voltage ratio is selected to coincide with
		      the supply voltage.
   3.9 For a Non-Hermetically sealed unit, and when fitted, please check, and bleed the Buchholz relay, bushings,
		      and radiators
   3.10 Check all shut off devices that they are in the selected position for normal operation.
   3.11 Off circuit tap changers can only be operated when the unit is NOT energised.
   3.12 On Load tap changer
		      3.12.1 Check the motor drive and record the number of operations on the on-load tap changer counter.
		      3.12.2 Compare whether the on-load tap changer position indicator reflects the same position as on the motor drive.
		      3.12.3 Switch the on-load tap changer through all its tap positions (extreme plus to extreme minus position)
		      3.12.4 Adjust the on-load tap changer to the preferred tap position corresponding to the rated supply voltage.
			            Switch the transformer on and listen for any unwanted noises.
		      3.12.5 Operate the on-load tap changer only within the permissible voltage range.

4. Maintenance and Repair
   4.1 Check gaskets and sealing of the transformer and, if necessary, retighten screws/bolts slightly.
   4.2 If the unit is fitted with an oil gauge, check the oil level at regular interval.
   4.3 Please keep insulators clean.
   4.4 Remove rust and recoat/repaint the affected areas or surfaces.
   4.5 Oil Drainage
		     If maintenance and repairs require opening of the transformer the following instructions must be followed:
		     4.5.1 Drain insulation fluid from the oil draining devise, mounted at the bottom of the tank.
			            In the event of a Hermetically sealed unit, the filling pipe must remain closed. Once no more liquid is flowing
			            from the device, the tank had been pressure compensated.
		     4.5.2 Open the filling pipe on the cover and drain the insulation fluid to about 50 mm under cover
			            (test with a measuring stick through the filling pipe to determine the correct oil level).

  4.6 Refilling of the oil
		      After the work have been completed, the transformers must be filled.
		 For Hermetically sealed units use the following steps:
		      4.6.1 Unscrew the cap on the filling pipe.
  4.6.2 Refill the transformers and filling pipe with oil.
