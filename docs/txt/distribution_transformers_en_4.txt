     OUR TOP 4
     Core, winding, assembly and housing: these four components and production steps are what characterizes our liquid-cooled
     distribution transformers. They are our “TOP 4”.

     The heart of our liquid-cooled distribution transformers:            Maximum resistance to
                                                                          • short-circuit load
     thanks to state-of-the art production procedures and high            • overvoltage peaks
     precision, it beats with particular endurance and power.

     This is what distinguishes cores manufactured in-house at SBG.

     • cold-rolled grain-oriented metal sheets
     • step-lap design
     • max. filling factor

     These measures reduce no-load losses and no-load currents as
     well as noise emission.
