OPERATING INSTRUCTION B / 2021

		     4.6.3 Bleed the bushings.
		     4.6.4. Fill the filling pipe again (to the brim) and close it with cap. Ensure that all other devices are also filled
			           (where required) and seal it.
		     4.6.5. Adjust the pressure level by draining a predetermined amount of oil, which is influenced by the oil 		
			           temperature (tolerance 3 K). The necessary information about oil temperature and the quantity of oil to be
			           drained are stipulated on the rating plate. The existing oil temperature can be measured with the
			           thermometer located in the thermometer pocket on the cover. Adjust the oil level with the filling pipe closed/
			           sealed, by draining the predetermined amount of oil, as stated on the rating plate. Use the oil drain device at
			           the bottom of the tank to drain the oil.
  4.7. Please observe the instructions of the protection and control systems.		

5. Oil Samples
   Occasional tests of oil samples and examination as per BA148 / VDE 0370 are recommended.
   Minimum breakdown voltage levels are:          New oil:		       ≥ 50 kV		
		       				                                     Operating oil:   ≥ 30 kV
   Purification of the oil is necessary at levels less than 30 kV.
   5.1 Taking Oil Samples at Oil Temperature ≥ Reference Temperature °C
		      At an oil temperature of ≥ the Reference Temperature the tank operates under excess pressure. An oil sample of
		      approximately 0.2 l is taken from the oil drainage device. The filling pipe must not be ventilated during this
		 procedure.

  5.2.   Taking Oil Samples at Oil Temperature < Reference Temperature °C
		       At an oil temperature of < the Reference Temperature the tank operates under negative pressure.
		       If the oil sample of approximately 0.2 l is to be taken from the drainage device, ventilate the filling pipe and then
		       refill according to the instructions given in section 4.5.
