Robust and short-circuit proof design of all modules indicate                 Most exacting criteria regarding permanent leak-tightness and
the value of the SBG-transformer.                                             corrosion resistance.

At SBG, all active parts are subjected to an electrical pre-test              At SBG, all tanks manufactured in-house are subjected to a fourfold
prior to installation in the tank.                                            leakage test in accordance with factory-specific standards. This
                                                                              ensures oil-proofness over the transformer’s entire service life!
